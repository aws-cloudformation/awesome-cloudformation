## CloudFormation Samples

The following are pre-built CloudFormation Samples demonstrating how to use AWS CloudFormation to construct various canned resources, modules, applications or resource groupings.

### Templates
- [aws-cf-templates](https://github.com/widdix/aws-cf-templates): Free Templates for AWS CloudFormation
- [aws-cloudformation-templates](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates): Sample AWS CloudFormation templates which are intended to support learning how to declare specific AWS resources or solve particular use cases.
- [aws-quickstart](https://github.com/aws-quickstart): Automated gold-standard deployments on AWS
- [asecure.cloud](https://asecure.cloud/): A free repository of customizable AWS security configurations and best practices

### Modules
- [aws-cloudformation-samples](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-samples/tree/main/modules): Reusable CloudFormation modules to jump start your collection.

## Authoring and Testing Tools

These tools are designed to assist in the authoring and testing process for AWS CloudFormation. Tools include template generation, linting and testing applications.

- [AWSConsoleRecorder](https://github.com/iann0036/AWSConsoleRecorder): Records actions made in the AWS Management Console and outputs the equivalent CLI/SDK commands and CloudFormation/Terraform templates.
- [Former2](https://github.com/iann0036/former2): Generate CloudFormation / Terraform / Troposphere templates from your existing AWS resource
- [cfn-python-lint](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-python-lint): Validate CloudFormation yaml/json templates against the CloudFormation spec and additional checks. Includes checking valid values for resource properties and best practices.
- [cfn-guard](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard): A set of tools to check AWS CloudFormation templates for policy compliance using a simple, policy-as-code, declarative syntax
- [Visual Studio Code extension](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/aws-cfn-lint-visual-studio-code): CloudFormation Linter integration, autocompletion, reference documentation links on hover
- [cfn_nag](https://github.com/stelligent/cfn_nag): The cfn-nag tool looks for patterns in CloudFormation templates that may indicate insecure infrastructure.
- [taskcat](https://github.com/aws-quickstart/taskcat): taskcat is a tool that tests AWS CloudFormation templates. It deploys your AWS CloudFormation template in multiple AWS Regions and generates a report with a pass/fail grade for each region.
- [org-formation](https://github.com/OlafConijn/AwsOrganizationFormation): a tool that helps you write CloudFormation for your AWS Organization resources and create links between regular cloudformation resources across your accounts and regions.
- [cfn checklist](https://cfnchecklist.com/): a list of of things to look out for before launching your infrastructure to production.
- [cfn flip](https://cfnflip.com/): a tool that converts AWS CloudFormation templates between JSON and YAML formats.
- [cfn-diagram](https://github.com/mhlabs/cfn-diagram): CLI tool to visualise CloudFormation templates as diagrams.

## CLI Tools

This section contains tools which have been designed to improve the experiene of interacting with the CloudFormation service through a terminal session.

- [awscfncli](https://github.com/Kotaimen/awscfncli): awscfncli helps build and manage complex AWS CloudFormation stacks.
- [stacker](https://github.com/cloudtools/stacker): An AWS CloudFormation Stack orchestrator/manager.
- [sceptre](https://github.com/Sceptre/sceptre): Sceptre is a tool to drive AWS CloudFormation. It automates the mundane, repetitive and error-prone tasks, enabling you to concentrate on building better infrastructure.

## Code Generation

If you prefer imperative coding, or just using your favourite programming language, the following projects are intended to abstract the creation of AWS CloudFormation templates.

- [aws-cdk](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk): The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software development framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation.
- [serverless-application-model](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model): The AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. It provides shorthand syntax to express functions, APIs, databases, and event source mappings. With just a few lines of configuration, you can define the application you want and model it.
- [eksctl](https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl): A CLI tool that uses CloudFormation to create clusters on EKS.
- [mu](https://github.com/stelligent/mu): Similar to how the Serverless Framework improved the developer experience of Lambda and API Gateway, this tool makes it easier for developers to use EKS or ECS as a microservices platform.
- [OpenJS Architect](https://github.com/architect/architect): Generate AWS CloudFormation and AWS Serverless Application Model code from a very terse and friendly high level manifest file written in `JSON`, `YAML`, `TOML` or `.arc` format
- [troposphere (Python)](https://github.com/cloudtools/troposphere): The troposphere library allows for easier creation of the AWS CloudFormation JSON by writing Python code to describe the AWS resources. troposphere also includes some basic support for OpenStack resources via Heat.
- [sparkleformation (Ruby)](https://github.com/sparkleformation): A magical Ruby infrastructure orchestration DSL
- [VaporShell (PowerShell)](https://github.com/scrthq/VaporShell): A PowerShell module for building, packaging and deploying AWS CloudFormation templates.

## Custom Resource Development

When you need to extend AWS CloudFormation to support your own personal or organizational use-cases, the following tools are intended to support the development experience with the [original Custom Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-custom-resources.html) functionality and the new [CloudFormation Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/11/now-extend-aws-cloudformation-to-model-provision-and-manage-third-party-resources/) experience.

- [cloudformation-cli](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-cli): The CloudFormation Provider Development Toolkit allows you to author your own resource providers that can be used by CloudFormation.
- [cloudformation-cli-go-plugin](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-cli-go-plugin): The CloudFormation Provider Development Toolkit Go Plugin allows you to autogenerate Go code based on an input schema.
- [cloudformation-cli-java-plugin](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-cli-java-plugin): The CloudFormation Provider Development Toolkit Java Plugin allows you to autogenerate Java code based on an input schema.
- [cloudformation-cli-python-plugin](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-cli-python-plugin): The CloudFormation Provider Development Toolkit Python Plugin allows you to autogenerate Python code based on an input schema.
- [custom-resource-helper](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/custom-resource-helper): Simplify best practice Custom Resource creation, sending responses to CloudFormation and providing exception, timeout trapping, and detailed configurable logging.
